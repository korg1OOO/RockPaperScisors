# RockPaperScisors
Project incorporating JS on a Rock Paper Scissors game.
I'm sorry for my horrendous styling, tried to do it pretty fast and focused on functionality instead of styling.
If you have styling ideas or feedback about this minigame hit me up on discord: korg1000, I'll be honoured to have a talk
